### Code Explanation

1. **Imports**:
   - The code imports necessary libraries, including `dash` for the web application framework, `pandas` for data manipulation, and `plotly.express` for creating visualizations.

2. **App Initialization**:
   - `app = dash.Dash(__name__)` initializes a new Dash application.

3. **Layout Definition**:
   - The layout of the dashboard is defined using `html.Div` to contain all components:
     - A title (`html.H1`).
     - A file upload component (`dcc.Upload`) for users to upload CSV or Excel files.
     - A div to display the uploaded data.
     - Dropdowns for selecting columns to visualize on the X and Y axes.
     - A graph area (`dcc.Graph`) to display the analytics.

4. **Data Parsing Function**:
   - `parse_data(contents, filename)` decodes the uploaded file's contents and attempts to read it into a DataFrame using `pandas`.
   - It supports both CSV and Excel formats and returns the DataFrame or `None` if an error occurs.

5. **Callback for File Upload**:
   - The `update_output` function is triggered when a file is uploaded:
     - It checks if the contents are `None` (no file uploaded) and returns empty outputs.
     - It parses the file using `parse_data` and creates options for the dropdowns based on the DataFrame's columns.
     - It updates a data table with the DataFrame's contents.

6. **Dropdown Callbacks**:
   - The `update_graph` function updates the graph based on the selected X and Y axes:
     - It checks if any required inputs are missing and returns an empty figure.
     - It re-parses the uploaded file and creates a scatter plot using the selected columns with `plotly.express`.

7. **App Execution**:
   - The application runs with `app.run_server(debug=True)`, which starts the Dash server and enables debug mode for easier development.

### Summary
This code sets up a Dash web application that allows users to upload CSV or Excel files, view the data in a table, and create visualizations by selecting columns for the X and Y axes. It demonstrates the power of Dash for building interactive data applications using Python. The architecture ensures the app remains responsive to user inputs while processing data in the background.
