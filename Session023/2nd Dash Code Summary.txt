### Code Explanation

1. **Imports and Class Definition**:
   - The code imports necessary libraries for GUI creation (`tkinter`), file handling, data analysis (`pandas`), threading, and plotting (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
   - The `DataAnalyzerApp` class encapsulates the application's functionality.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The constructor (`__init__`) sets up the main window, title, buttons for selecting and analyzing files, a tree view for displaying files, and a scrolled text area for displaying error messages.

3. **File Selection**:
   - The `select_files` method uses a file dialog to let users choose CSV or Excel files. Selected file names are displayed in the tree view, and their paths are stored in a dictionary.

4. **File Analysis**:
   - The `analyze_files` method checks for selected files and starts a separate thread for each file to analyze it using `analyze_file`.

5. **File Analysis Logic**:
   - In `analyze_file`, the method reads the file (CSV or Excel) into a DataFrame, then gathers and sends the shape and column types back to the main thread through a queue.
   - It calculates detailed statistics for numerical columns using the `calculate_detailed_statistics` method.
   - The data is plotted using `plot_data`, which creates various visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and 3D scatter plots) in a dedicated plot area.

6. **Queue Processing**:
   - The `process_queue` method runs periodically to check for new messages in the queue and update the tree view and error display accordingly.

7. **Double Click Event**:
   - The `on_node_double_click` method allows users to double-click a file in the tree view to trigger its analysis again.

8. **Main Loop**:
   - The application is run in the main loop, which keeps the window active and responsive.

### Summary
This code creates a data analysis application with a user-friendly interface. Users can select data files, analyze them, view summary statistics, and visualize the data, all within a graphical environment. The use of threading ensures the GUI remains responsive while processing files.
