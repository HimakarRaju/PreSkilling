# Data Science & Visualization

## What is data analysis ?

Data analysis is the process of examining data sets in order to create new knowledge, inform business decisions, or address other business or social needs.
Fundamentally, data analysis is the process of collecting, processing, and analyzing data to extract useful information and insights.

## Why Data Analysis?

Data analysis is the process of extracting insights and meaningful patterns from data. It involves using various techniques, tools, and methods to examine data sets, identify trends, and draw conclusions. The goal of data analysis is to turn data into information, which can then be used to inform business decisions, solve problems, or answer questions.

## Key Steps in Data Analysis

**Data Collection:** Gathering data from various sources, such as databases, spreadsheets, or external data providers.
**Data Cleaning:** Ensuring the quality and accuracy of the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors.
**Data Transformation:** Converting data into a suitable format for analysis, such as aggregating data or creating new variables.
**Data Analysis:** Applying statistical and analytical techniques to identify patterns, trends, and correlations.
**Data Visualization:** Presenting findings in a clear and concise manner using charts, graphs, and other visualization tools.
**Insight Generation:** Interpreting results, identifying key findings, and drawing conclusions.

## Types of Data Analysis

**Descriptive Analytics:** Examining historical data to understand what happened.
**Diagnostic Analytics:** Analyzing data to identify the causes of a problem.
**Predictive Analytics:** Using statistical models to forecast future events.
**Prescriptive Analytics:** Providing recommendations based on data analysis.

## Tools and Techniques Used in Data Analysis

**Spreadsheets:** Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets
**Statistical Software:** R, Python, SAS
**Data Visualization Tools:** Tableau, Power BI, D3.js
**Machine Learning Libraries:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch

# What we did

1. Discussed about the Data Science
2. Worked on Student Performance metrics using the Student_Performance_Metrics dataset using Excel
 1. Things needed to be analyzed
  GOAL - IMPROVE STUDENTS PERFORMANCE
  4. Previous score vs current score - did the student perform better or not?
	a. if not then what can be done?
	b. does those student perform better in other activities? If yes then help them pursue their passion and help them with the studies to get a better score.
  c. if this is also not the case, then employ better teaching strategies for them like customised classes.
  6. How parental involvement, peer influence and motivational levels depends upon previous score and how it has affected the current scores? - if there is a negative relationship, i.e. less parental involvement and less marks then it would be better to held a parent-teacher meeting.
  Student attendance vs scores. Necessary to implement policies regarding 75% attendance.
  7. Access to resource vs student score - if resources are limited and student has scored low, then provide more access.
  8. Hours Studies vs student score - students studies less and scored high - studies more hours and scored less
  9. Parental educational level vs students score
  10. Distance from home effects students education/score/attendance and sleeping hours.
  11. Is Teacher quality dependent upon school type and how it affects student's education?
